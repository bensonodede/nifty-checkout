    "question": "Do you handle shipping?",
    "answer": "Currently, we don't handle shipping. We simply don't have the capacity to run a delivery operation that is cost-effective and works great. We love our users, it would be a shame to disappoint you and your customers with a delivery service that sucks. \n\nFor these reasons, we have chosen not to provide shipping options."
